     * The frustum base class.
     * A frustum is a convex volume which we can use for several
     * visibility related things, like occlusion culling.
     * The frustum is constructed out of planes and the class provides
     * methods to quickly determine if several bounding volume objects are
     * intersection this volume or not. Also it's possible to detect if
     * these bounding volume objects are completely inside the volume or not.
     * This is especially usefull for occlusion culling. If the bounding box
     * of an object is completely inside the occluders frustums volume, it means
     * that this object will be invisible.
     * The same can be used for view frustum culling. If an objects bounding volume
     * is partially or completely inside the volume, it means it's visible to the viewer.
     * Don't forget that the frustum has to be CONVEX in order to work correctly.
